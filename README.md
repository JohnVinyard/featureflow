# featureflow
featureflow is a python library that allows users to build feature extraction pipelines in a declarative way, and store the results for later use

# Installation

Python headers are required.

```bash
apt-get install python-dev
```

Numpy is optional.  If you'd like to use it, the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution is highly recommended.

Finally, just

```bash
pip install featureflow
```
